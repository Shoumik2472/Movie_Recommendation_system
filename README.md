# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a machine learning-based movie recommendation system designed to enhance user personalization and engagement. The system employs collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to recommend movies based on user preferences and movie metadata.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggests movies tailored to individual users' tastes.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering for improved accuracy.
- **Similarity Computation:** Leverages cosine similarity to identify similar movies based on metadata.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
  - scikit-learn for model implementation and evaluation
  - Flask (optional) for API deployment

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset (e.g., movies and user ratings).
   - Preprocessed tags and metadata for vectorization.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Used **CountVectorizer** from scikit-learn to transform movie tags into vector arrays.
   - Computed similarities between movies using **cosine_similarity**.

3. **Recommendation Logic:**
   - Implemented collaborative filtering to recommend movies based on user-item interactions.
   - Used content-based filtering to suggest movies with similar metadata.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assessed system performance using metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and precision.

5. **Deployment (Optional):**
   - Deployed the recommendation engine as a REST API using Flask.
   - Containerized the application using Docker for scalable production deployment.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. (Optional) Access the API at `http://localhost:5000` if using Flask for deployment.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate deep learning models (e.g., neural collaborative filtering) for better prediction accuracy.
- Enable real-time recommendation updates.
- Incorporate user feedback for adaptive learning.
